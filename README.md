## InspIRCd Packages

## About

This repository contains scripts used for generating packages for InspIRCd. It
is nowhere near finished so you should probably not use it just yet. Poke me
(SaberUK) in #inspircd.dev on irc.inspircd.org if you have any questions though.

## Requirements

- Git
- Rake
- Ruby 2.0+

If you are using an old distribution which does not ship Ruby 2.0+ then you can
install it with [RVM](http://rvm.io/rvm/install).

## Usage

Run `rake` with no target to view a list of package targets which can be built.

## License

These scripts are licensed under the same license as InspIRCd (GPLv2).
